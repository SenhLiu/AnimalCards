# AnimalCards
Android barcode scanner for the Animal Cards promotion by Countdown of New Zealand in 2015.

A very simple scanner which can read the barcodes off the Animal Cards. If a card is read the app will display some related information about the animal. Can also play animal sounds for selected cards.

Requires Netbeans with the nbandroid plugin to build.
