The proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus) or long-nosed monkey, known as the bekantan in Malay, is a reddish-brown arboreal Old World monkey that is endemic to the south-east Asian island of Borneo. This species co-exists with the Bornean Orang-utan. It belongs in the monotypic genus Nasalis, although the pig-tailed langur has traditionally also been included in this genus.<p>

The monkey also goes by the Malay name monyet belanda ("Dutch monkey"), or even orang belanda ("Dutchman"), as Indonesians remarked that the Dutch colonisers often had similarly large bellies and noses.<p>

This species of monkey is easily identifiable because of its unusually large nose.<p>
