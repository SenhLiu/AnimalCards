The long-nosed horned frog (Megophrys nasuta), also known as the Malayan horned frog or Malayan leaf frog is a species of frog restricted to the rainforest areas of southern Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia to Singapore, Sumatra and Borneo. However, records from Thailand to the Sunda Shelf may apply to another, possibly unnamed species.<p>

This species is a large frog ranging from 100-120 mm in length. They are light to dark brown on the dorsal surface with varying patterns and camouflage very well with the forest floor. The throat is black-dark brown and diffuses into cream-yellow halfway along the ventral surface. The upper eyelids and snout are drawn out into long triangular projections, forming what looks like "horns", giving them their common name. There are two pairs of dorsolateral skin folds running down this species back. One pair starts behind the eye and ends near the groin, the other pair starts at corner of the eye and ends roughly halfway between the armpit and groin. The dorsum has randomly scattered, enlarged tubercles. Arms and legs are barred with skin folds and are mottled cream and different shades of brown. The toes are slightly webbed and the fingers are free from webbing. The tympanum is indistinct and the iris is golden brown.<p>
