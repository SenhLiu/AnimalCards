<b>Mantis shrimp</b> or <b>stomatopods</b> are marine crustaceans, the members of the order <b>Stomatopoda</b>. They commonly reach 30 centimetres (12 in) in length, though in exceptional cases have been recorded at up to 38 cm (15 in). The largest ever caught has a length of 46 cm (18 in) in the ocean near Fort Pierce, Florida of USA. The carapace of mantis shrimp covers only the rear part of the head and the first four segments of the thorax. There are more than 400 species of Mantis shrimp. They come in a variety of colours, from shades of brown to bright neon colours and are among the most important predators in many shallow, tropical and sub-tropical marine habitats. Despite being common, they are poorly understood as many species spend most of their life tucked away in burrows and holes.<p>

Called "sea locusts" by ancient Assyrians, "prawn killers" in Australia and now sometimes referred to as "thumb splitters" - because of the animal's ability to inflict painful gashes if handled incautiously - mantis shrimps sport powerful claws that they use to attack and kill prey by spearing, stunning, or dismemberment. In captivity, some larger species are capable of breaking through aquarium glass with a single strike.<p>
