The black-tailed trainbearer (Lesbia victoriae) is a species of hummingbird in the Trochilidae family. It is found in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland, and heavily degraded former forest. The males of this extreme species are 18-25 cm (7.1-9.8 in) long and are the same or even greater overall length as the largest hummingbird (the giant hummingbird) but most of that length is made up by their very long tail streamers. Females are 13-15 cm (5.1-5.9 in) long.<p>
