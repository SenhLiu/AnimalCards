Bitis gabonica, commonly known as the Gaboon viper, is a venomous viper species found in the rainforests and savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. This is not only the largest member of the genus Bitis, but also the world's heaviest viperid, and it has the longest fangs, up to 2 inches (5 cm), and the highest venom yield of any venomous snake. Two subspecies are currently recognised.<p>
