The tiger pistol shrimp or Alpheus bellulus belongs to the family of snapping shrimp.<p>

Alpheus bellulus can grow to a size up to 4 to 5 cm, not including antennae. The body is stout and opaque. The background color of the body is yellowish white or plain yellow. The patterns drawn on the cephalothorax, abdomen and tail are irregular but symmetric, their coloration varies from light brown, brownish purple to brownish orange. The legs are banded with the same colors as the body and are covered with short bristles. The antennae are red. The chelipeds are also banded, with the right cheliped being bigger and modified into a powerful weapon. By closing at extreme speed, the cheliped expels an air bubble at more than 100 km per hour (62.1371 miles per hour) towards the prey. This action is accompanied with a loud bang. This powerful sonic weapon creates a violent shock wave which can kill or knock out prey, which could be another shrimp or a small fish passing close to the Alpheus bellulus.<p>
