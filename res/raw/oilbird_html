The oilbird (Steatornis caripensis), locally known as the guacharo, is a bird found in the northern areas of South America (including the island of Trinidad in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago). They are nocturnal feeders on the fruits of the oil palm and tropical laurels, and are the only nocturnal flying fruit-eating birds in the world (the kakapo is flightless). They forage at night, navigating by echolocation in the same way as bats, but with a high-pitched clicking sound of around 2 kHz that is audible to humans.<p>
