Myobatrachus gouldii, the turtle frog, is a Western Australian frog and the only species in the genus Myobatrachus. It has a small head, short limbs, and a round body, up to 45 millimetres (1.8 in) long.<p>

The turtle frog is found in between Geraldton and Fitzgerald River in the Perth region, Western Australia. This area is mainly semi-arid, so the frogs have adapted to suit this region. They have developed short muscular limbs to help them dig into the sand but, unlike most frogs, they dig forwards, like a turtle. They feed on termites so the adaptation of the muscular limbs is useful when trying to break into a termite mound.<p>
