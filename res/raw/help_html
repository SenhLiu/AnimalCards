<b>How to use</b><p>

Press the [Scan Barcode] button and place the red line over the barcode. Tap the screen to scan the barcode. If a matching barcode is found the associated Animal Card will be shown.<p>

If an Animal Card is shown press the [Read More] button to discover more information about the animal. Some animals may have a sound file so press the [Play Sound] button (if available) to hear the animal.<p>

<b>Tips</b><p>

Position the card so that the barcode portion is at the top of the card.<p>

Hold the camera steady and scan the barcode in a well lit place.<p>

Avoid casting a shadow over part or all of the barcode.<p>

Try zooming in as close to the barcode as possible while still keeping a focussed image.<p>

If all else fails try turning the card upside down and scanning from the other direction.<p>

Unfortunately not all cameras are suitable for scanning barcodes. If repeated attempts fail try selecting the card manually from the [Pick Card] menu option.<p>

This scanner has only been tested with the Countdown Super Animal Cards promotion of 2015.<p>
